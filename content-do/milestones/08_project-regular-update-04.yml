  You should update us regularly about your current progress, challenges and issues you are facing. This helps us to guide you into the right direction - if necessary - and it helps you to reflect on all of your accomplishments so far.

  To do so, please set up a meeting with your Journey Project Manager and provide him/her with a short summary of what you've been doing.
