  This is a mandatory event!

  !! We had to change this event from an in person event to an online event !!

  We will foster your creativity to imagine project ideas based on real-world problems and further continue working on the brainstormed project ideas from the Project Phase DeepDive.

  You will be able to learn about and participate in ideation methods from the Design Thinking Space.
  Of course this will be guided by TechLabs Dortmund team members and Design Thinking Experts!
