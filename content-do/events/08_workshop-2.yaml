  What is project management and what are the success factors for a successful project?
  This question is not only on the minds of project managers, but also of entire organizations and, last but not least, project teams. There are a lot of methods and tools that provide a good starting point for a smooth project start and yet it is not said for nothing "A fool with a tool is still a fool". At least as important are the right mindset and the right collaboration within teams.
  Especially in software development people rely on agility and Scrum for project management. But what exactly is behind all the buzzwords?
  Our partners at [Accenture Interactive](https://www.accenture.com/de-de/about/accenture-interactive-index) give you their best practices and lessons learned for managing software projects in a team. They’ll give you recommendations how you guys can manage your upcoming projects and work together to deliver great results & projects for the end of your Digital Shaper Program. You’ll also get the opportunity to ask them anything you’d like to know about agile, scrum.
  _Please be aware that this is a __mandatory event__ to complete the Digital Shaper Program and receive your certificate. If, for any reason, you’re not available to join this event, please let us know in advance._
