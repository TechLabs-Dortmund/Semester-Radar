  Dear Techies, theres approximately one month left in your Digital Shaper Program with TechLabs. Look at how far you’ve come. You’ve learned a lot, you’ve built a lot, and you’ve probably failed a lot - so far!
  The closing highlight of you programs will be our closing ceremony, where you’ll get to present your projects and display how far you’ve come - or to be more precisely, you’ll pitch your projects.
  As the skills of presenting, captivating and convincing others of your ideas and what you have to say, we’ll support you with a pitch workshop on March 17th from 7 - 8.30 PM.
  This interactive workshop is about the preparation for the project pitches at the final event.
  The content will cover presentation techniques and the structure of a pitch. You will then be able to practice what you have learned and get feedback on your own small pitch. Finally, you will receive further information on the planning of the final event.
  Also, we will have a special guest to join us: Julian, founder & CEO of meal planning app Choosy from Bochum, will provide you with a real-live example of how to excite others with a pitch of your product and he’ll also answer some of the practical questions you might have.
  We hope you’re as excited as we are!
