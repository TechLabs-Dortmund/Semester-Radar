  This is where your Digital Shaper Journey will start. We'll give you a summary on all you need to know to master your track.
  Our topics include:

  1. **Key Facts** regarding TechLabs, the Digital Shaper program, certificate and community
  2. **Administrative Topics** – your onboarding to our toolset, communication channels, regular meetings & next steps
  3. **Track Get-Together** – you'll meet other participants in the track you're planning to choose, and can ask the Track Leads for more information

  Our goal is for everybody to have a clear understanding about TechLabs Dortmund. We will share the link to join here a few days before the event.
