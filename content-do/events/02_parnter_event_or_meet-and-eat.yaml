  Please note: We rescheduled the event to be one day prior! - Community is at the heart of the Digital Shaper Program, and we're here to help you build it! Join us for Meet&Eat, an event all about connecting with fellow participants in a relaxed, friendly setting. Over some good food and great conversations, you'll have the chance to chat about everything from hobbies to personal interests, sparking new connections and friendships. 🌟

  We're excited to bring everyone together for a fun, casual evening—come ready to share, laugh, and make memories with the incredible people in our program! 🥂
