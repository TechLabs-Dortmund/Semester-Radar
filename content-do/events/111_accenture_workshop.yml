We’re sure in the past weeks while kicking off your projects, you whether intuitively or explicitly encountered project management. To build onto the basics,  our friends at Accenture Interactive will dive with you into modern project management & also show you what is behind the buzz words **Agile** & **Scrum**.
In this event, the Accenture Interactive team will give you some tipps on how to navigate difficult times in a project and how to focus on delivering a successful end result.
For anyone interested in joining Accenture Interactive in Dortmund (or any other location) as a working student, intern, or in junior/senior positions, this is a great opportunity to get to know the team and leave a positive impression :zwinkern:
